                <em>PMQ Pizza Magazine</em> is launching PizzaVegan.com, a website community designed to bring more
                attention to&mdash;and consumers closer to&mdash;vegan pizza through exclusive editorial content, a
                product guide, recipes, a directory of independent pizzerias offering vegan pizza, and a kickoff
                promotion that begins on World Vegan Day, November 1! Through PizzaVegan.com, vegan consumers will have
                an unprecedented opportunity to find vegan versions of Americans' favorite food: pizza.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary-text">Why Now?</h5>
            <p>Vegan pizza has never been more popular than it is now. Here's a look at the numbers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    60% of Americans have started to eat a more plant-based diet since the beginning of the pandemic,
                    according to a recent poll of 2,000 adults by OnePoll. Respondents cited health as the No. 1 reason
                    for this change, but they also cited a desire to consume less animal products and lead a more
                    sustainable lifestyle. The same poll revealed that 39% of people ages 18 to 25, and 23% of people
                    ages 26 to 41, already exclude animal products from their diets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ADM reports that 44% of U.S. consumers identify as flexitarians&mdash;those who eat a mostly vegetarian
                    diet, with occasional servings of meat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The average American eats four meat-free meals per week, and 50% of Americans are trying to
                    incorporate more plant-based meals in their daily lives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    25% of customers are looking for vegan pizza options, but only 25% of pizzerias are offering them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 2019, plant-based food sales had increased by 31% over the last two years, according to the
                    Plant Based Foods Association.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plant-based options are the fastest growing section on pizza menus today, notes trends expert
                    Daniel Levine of the Avant-Guide Institute in New York City.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="primary-text">How It Works</h5>
            <p>As a participating pizzeria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    own ordering link), an image, and a description of your vegan pizza offering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Display point-of-sale elements, such as a window cling, box topper, table tent, door hanger and
